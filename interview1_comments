Comments:

I was happy to see that the team is on the same page and collaborating
well. I suggest you put more effort into preparing for the second
interview, so that it looks and sounds more professional.


The team introduction was done well. I suggest that you focus more on
the profesisonal aspects of the team for the second interview.


The project was introduced well. I suggest you practice the demo in
preparing for the second interview, to make sure it goes smoothly and
looks more professional.

The reasons for selecting the project were presented well.


Process: As we have discussed, I would be happy to replace this part
of the interview grade with what you achieve in the second interview.
